 I completed my first presentation for the virtual internship at Codebasics. Using a PowerBi Dashboard, I analyzed data and provided actionable insights to stakeholders via a PowerPoint presentation. This helped them make data-driven decisions, enhance operations, and take further steps. The topic was 'hashtag#Wavecon hashtag#Telecom: 5G Launch Impact Analysis'. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ– 

Objective:
Analyze the dashboard and provide insights by addressing key questions.

Introduction:
Wavecon Telecom is one of the leading telecom service providers in India. They have recently launched 5G services across major cities and are keen to understand the impact of this launch.

Key Questions:
1. What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?
2. Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?
3. Which plans are performing well in terms of revenue post-5G launch? Which plans are not?
4. Is there any plan significantly affected by the 5G launch? Should we continue or discontinue that plan?
5. Has any plan been discontinued after the 5G launch? What are the reasons?

This task has greatly enhanced my analytical skills and boosted my confidence in presenting insights. Also, this is my first presentation.
